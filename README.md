# cs36300-fall2018-assignment1


Task - For this programming assignment, you will design and implement a standard array class for characters, i.e., chartypes. The goal of this programming assignment is to provide a refresher for programming abstract data types (ADTs) in C++. You therefore do not have to completely design and implement an array class in C++. Instead, the design of the array class has been provided for you. It is your job to implement the design given its source code shells by implementing the correct functionality for each method. The requirements for each method is specified in the arrayâ€™s header file (i.e., Array.h).
